# Cloud Bigtable

1. True or false: Each table in NoSQL databases such as Cloud Bigtable has a single schema that is enforced by the database engine itself.

- [ ] True
- [X] False

2. Some developers think of Cloud Bigtable as a persistent hashtable. What does that mean?

- [ ] Each item in the database consists of the exact same field, and can be looked up based on a variety of keys.
- [X] Each item in the database can be sparsely populated, and is looked up with a single key.
